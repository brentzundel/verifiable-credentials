PROPOSAL: Publish the Data Integrity ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
specification as a Candidate Recommendation on 28 September 2023
(https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-ecdsa/CR/2023-09-28/) with a CR period
ending on the last day of November 2023 and with exit criteria
requiring two independent implementations of each mandatory (MUST)
feature in the specification.

# Changes

https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-ecdsa/CR/2023-09-28/#revision-history

# Requirements satisfied

Yes.

# Dependencies met (or not)

There is one dependency on Multibase, which is expected to be
published by a new IETF Multiformats Working Group. If the
dependencies fail to materialize in a stable way, the specification
contains specific Multibase values that can be used such that an
external dependency is not necessary.
